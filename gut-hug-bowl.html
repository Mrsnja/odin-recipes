        Looking for a warm snack? Only have a bunch of seemingly
        random ingredients in your fridge? Scared to throw them
        together, but decided, oh, what the heck? Me too!
        <br>
        <br>
        It really was just one of those moments when I needed
        a nurturing meal. I've been dealing with chronic 
        inflammation and digestion issues for years, so recently
        I've been following a whole foods, balanced meals
        approach. Within just a few weeks, I've already noticed
        some major healing.
        <br>
        <br>
        The thing is though, it can be overwhelming trying to make
        complicated meals every night. Sometimes you're hungry
        and you just want something warm and fast. This is exactly
        what I needed the night this recipe was born.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you're like me, you may make these things in bulk, so 
        all you have to do is throw it together, warm it up, mix it,
        and enjoy! Not a bulk prepper? That's fine too, this meals 
        is so good and healing, you're going to want to make it
        anyway. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now it's time for the recipe.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 baked chicken thigh</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1/4 baked sweet potato</li>
        <li>3 tbsp whole milk yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp seeds (flax, chia, and or hemp)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup kimchi</li>
        <li>splash of lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash baked sweet potato and rice together with yogurt.
        </li>
        <li>Wilt spinach on stove with oil or in microwave for 30
            seconds. Add to bowl and mix.
        </li>
        <li>Chop cooked chicken thigh and toss on top.
        </li>
        <li>Add Kimchi, top with seeds, and add some zest with a
            splash of lemon juice.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Although I gave instructions for a single bowl, all of these 
    ingredients are great to cook in bulk, have on hand, and it 
    be incredibly easy to scale this up or repeat for each person.
    I love the mix of soft sweet food with the mild spicy crunch
    of the kimch. And with one bowl of food, youre getting protein,
    starch, leafy greens, healthy fats, prebiotics, and probiotics.
    <br>
    <br>
    What could be better!
