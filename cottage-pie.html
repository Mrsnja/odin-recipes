        If you're in the mood for a something sweet and savory,
        try this new spin on Cottage Pie aka shepards pie. This 
        recipe came about one night while trying to figure out
        what to have for dinner with 2lbs of ground beef that
        needed to be cooked right away. Of course, the beef had 
        been an impulse buy from the store's last minute discount
        items, so I hadn't put in any planning when I picked it up.
        So there I stood, in my kitchen, at 5pm, trying to figure
        out what could be made with the ingredients I already had.
        <br>
        <br>
        Oh!
        <br>
        <br>
        What luck!
        <br>
        <br>
        I had all the fixings for a warm comforting cottage pie.
        <br>
        <br>
        Well, at least that's what I thought. As I began browning
        the meat and adding the veggies, I got my potatoes out to
        boil. That's when I realized the problem. We did have small 
        golden potatoes, I knew that, but it turned out I didn't have
        enough. Thankfully, I happened to have some sweet potato on 
        hand. Even though I wasn't sure how it would turn out, I 
        decided to give it a go.
        <br>
        <br>
        The result was fantastic. It was that same soothing savory
        feeling that one is accustomed too, but also had wonderfully
        sweet undertones. This recipe is truly too delicious to keep
        to myself, so I'm sharing it with all of you!

        Without further ado, here's the recipe.
