    <p>    
        On a day you're looking for a super simple dinner, this 
        is the one you want. The recipe is so incredibly easy that 
        there's not much to say. The photo speaks for itself!

        Of course, I am a fan for traditional salsa chicken too, but 
        sometimes you just want something a bit different. A step outside 
        of the typical tomato based sauce that you're used to. But that 
        doesn't mean you're ready to go adventuring into completely 
        unknown territory just yet to make a dish you've never heard of.
        <br>
        <br>
        So if you're in the mood for something a bit spicy and oh 
        so yummy, but still feels familiar, this is the meal for you.
        <br>
        <br>
